<h2>Education</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan
        <ul>
            <li>Interdisciplinary science department, environmental science major (PEAK ES course), 2020-present</li>
            <li>Sub-major in informatics</li>
            <li>Sub-major in general system</li>
            <li>I am the only student to take two sub-majors since the establishment of my current program at The University of Tokyo in 2013.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Working/Internship Experiences</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NJUECO Research Institute, Nanjing, China
        <ul>
            <li>Internship, Feb 2022 - Mar 2022</li>
            <li>Internship at Nanjing University ECO Development and Clean Technology Research Institute, a research and technology start-up platform in Nanjing University. I studied intensively on environmental impact assessment. Additionally, I took part in conferences centered on innovations in environmental science, engaging in meaningful discussions about technology start-ups fostered by growing environmental concerns with my colleagues.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Research Experiences/Projects</h2>
<ul>
    <li>UT-MIT Project on material and energy science, Tokyo, Japan and Boston, MA, USA
        <ul>
            <li>Feb 2023 - Mar 2023</li>
            <li>Visited Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) DMSE under the UT-MIT international lecture program (3.004 Principles of Engineering Practice) conducted jointly by the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tokyo and the Department of Material Science and Engineering (DMSE) at MIT. We learned about different kinds of energy generation systems. I played a vital role in a competition with MIT students to develop a better photovoltaic layout with higher efficiency, which is the final project of this course.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fluorescence Microscope Creative Design Project, Tokyo, Japan
        <ul>
            <li>Mar 2023 - Jul 2023</li>
            <li>During the course experiments in Environmental Science II, I worked as team leader to design and build a fluorescence microscope. With the purpose of finding a cheap and affordable way to build such instruments, we approached this problem using 3D printing. I contributed to this project by providing all the codes and most of the 3D designs to make the microscope system stable and precise. We managed to assemble such a system for under 100 dollars while a fluorescence microscope in the market, on average, charges around 10k dollars.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
